# Dog-Party-2019
<h1>Objective</h2>
Overview
Based on the expections of a front end developer, we are going to need to be able to accurately build out the UI (user interface) for websites based on comps provided by a designer. Our first project involves us building a 1-page static site  which will help us practice writing html and clean, effective css. We were given a comp with some technical specifications that we were to attempt to match as best we could.
